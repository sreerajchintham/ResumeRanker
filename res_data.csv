Sometimes we sleep in the office. Sometimes we chat with clients at 3am. Sometimes we don't sleep at all. We work on weekends. We're hustlers and thrive on the craziness. But, we all have balanced lives outside of work and prioritize those things that are important to us. Family, friends, nights out, music, and the abundant nature that exists outside of our beautiful city - we play just as hard as we work.Defend or DieAt GoRefi, we're insanely passionate about fixing our broken industry. Transparency with our clients is paramount so it's only natural that our work environment embody the same openness. With so many ideas and only so much bandwidth to execute, open communication is key. We're small, lean, and nimble so your opinion is expected and respected. But, when you present an idea, be ready to defend it - because we question everything. It's this type of collaboration that helps us decide what to focus our energies on next.Strive for PerfectionWe fail every day, and it's awesome, because it means we're getting closer. There's a push to get our features out there and it's often a sacrifice to hit those deadlines, but given the sensitive nature of what GoRefi does, putting features out just for the sake of putting features out doesn't fly. We prefer to take a bit of extra time to do it right, even though we're moving at light speed compared to our competitors.Don't be a ""Larry""No offense if your name is Larry, of course. In this example, Larry's the typical used-car salesman selling you rust protection when you live in California or the fly-by-night mortgage broker charging you exorbitant fees and putting you in the wrong loan. This lie-cheat-steal crap is all over the web and in case you couldn't tell already - we're sick of it. A Larry is enticed by quotas - not service - and is compensated without justification of hours worked or exceptional performance. They sell for themselves and for their wallet, with a short-term vision that hurts everyone in their lives, especially their customers. At GoRefi, we don't have a Sales Department - we only have Support. Our clients get what's best for them and only them. Our motive is and always will be to ensure that our clients are happy with their experience.","Full-Stack Software Engineer - San Francisco/Fairfax, CA#URL_4b8a8c7911c73321dea3236076d03c7a75f783e4b6fd81447c55fc17976370d8#GoRefi is building a platform for automating the front-end mortgage origination process, an annual $1.8T vertical that ultimately touches the lives of over 70 million Americans.

Organizations and individuals from around the world supplement our input in areas of activity needing particular attention. Increasingly, to integrate fully within national economies, we form companies and associations within client companies.Much of what we do is funded by international development agencies, or by clients themselves. It saves them money in the short term through our cost-effective purchase and delivery, in the medium term through our efficient management of projects, and in the long term by building up our clients' capacity to achieve their full commercial and economic potential.What we doProtechnique Ltd. provides integrated solutions to the infrastructure and project requirements of our clients across a range of industries and geographic locations.Our skills include: contracting, project management, electrical and mechanical engineering and maintenance, industrial engineering, infrastructure construction, architecture, information technology services, automotive services, healthcare services, training and capacity building in the areas of Agriculture, Healthcare, Human Rights, IT, Media, and Education.","Petroleum engineers' jobs typically involve research and production of natural gas and crude oil. More specifically, their job is to apply their knowledge of oil and gas, and how these hydrocarbons behave at a high pressure, in order to estimate the recoverable volume of the hydrocarbons, and maximize the recovery of the resources from subsurface reservoirs.There are several types of petroleum engineering jobs: reservoir engineering, drilling engineering, and production engineering jobs.Reservoir engineers are in charge of tasks related to well placement, oil recovery, and production rates, and they work to improve the production of oil and gas. Their job is to apply their knowledge of how oil and gas flow through rocks and what forces are involved in order to forecast the performance of reservoirs, set up well-drainage patterns, and improve the overall production efficiency.Drilling engineers deal with the technical tasks of drilling production and injection wells. They design drilling techniques, choose safety and casing equipment and decide on the direction of the operations.Production engineers evaluate lift methods, choose the equipment used to separate oil, water and natural gas, and are in charge of managing the interface between the reservoir and the well. Their job typically begins after the well has been completed. They manage and measure the fluids, design storage systems, and supply pipeline companies with oil and gas.Petroleum geology is another subdiscipline in the field of petroleum engineering, one that deals with analysis of subsurface structures for the purpose of finding hydrocarbons."," Skills An excellent technical capability and knowledge of geophysics, economics, drilling, well engineering, reservoir engineering, and petroleum geology is a must. Petroleum engineers must understand different types of rocks and how they behave under pressure. Since petroleum engineers usually work alongside geologists and other experts from related fields, good teamwork and communications skills are essential.Problem solving and analytical skills as well as the ability to think creatively and solve complex problems are key to career success. Petroleum engineers often organize and oversee the machinery and materials used in drilling operations, so management and negotiation skills are a definite career advantage in the long term. Qualifications Petroleum engineers can enter the field with a degree in engineering, mathematics or applied sciences. Some of the specific disciplines that give job candidates a competitive edge are chemical engineering, earth engineering, petroleum engineering, astrophysics, civil engineering, and mechanical engineering. The Institute of Petroleum Engineering at Heriot-Watt University offers master's degree courses and has the largest research program in the UK.Candidates with an HND or foundation degree alone usually cannot find employment in the field, as most companies have recruitment policies that are very specific about graduate or postgraduate qualifications.","Day-to-day duties of a petroleum engineer include analyzing well-logging results, meeting with reservoir and production engineers, and other experts, and forecasting production potential, selecting equipment to be used within the well, creating pumps and other systems that help the well to flow, making recommendations on ways to enhance well flow, liaising with contractors to discuss issues related to health, safety and environmental performance, and supervising the team and operations at the well site.",1,1,1,Full-time,Executive,Bachelor's Degree,Oil & Energy,Engineering,0
